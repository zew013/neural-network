Implemented a Neural Network function in Python and coded Backpropation, Mini-Batch Gradient Descent, Cross Validation with NumPy from scratch. Added Early Stopping, Momentum, L1 & L2 Regularization to improve the model. Did experiments using sigmoid, tanh, ReLU, softmax as activation functions.
1. main.py is the driver code that has to be run in order to run different set of experiments
2. run get_cifar10data.sh to download the data. The dataset will be downloaded in 'data' directory 
3. config files need to be in the 'config' directory
